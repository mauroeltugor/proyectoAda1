            <h3>meaning</h3>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport played on a rectangular court, where two teams of five players
                each try to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop <br> mounted 10 feet high on a
                backboard at each end of the court. The game involves passing, dribbling, and shooting the
                ball, and players must constantly <br> move and make split-second decisions to outmaneuver
                their opponents. The team with the most points at the end of the game, which usually
                lasts for four quarters of 12 minutes each, <br> wins. Basketball is not just a sport, but
                also a cultural phenomenon that has a global following, with millions of fans and players
                around the world.</p>
            <h3>rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dribbling: Players are not allowed to carry the ball while moving. They must bounce the ball off the
                    ground with one hand while walking or running to advance it up the court.</li>

                <li>Passing: Players may pass the ball to a teammate using their hands. The ball can be passed in any
                    direction, but the pass must not be thrown too hard or too high.</li>

                <li>Shooting: Players score points by shooting the ball into the opponent's basket. A successful shot
                    from
                    within the three-point line <br>is worth two points, while a shot from beyond the three-point line
                    is
                    worth three points.</li>

                <li> Fouls: Players must not physically interfere with other players. Contact that is deemed excessive,
                    rough, or unsportsmanlike is called a foul. <br>Players can be penalized with a loss of possession
                    or
                    free throws awarded to the other team.</li>

                <li> Time Limits: A regulation basketball game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. If
                    the
                    game is tied after regulation, additional time is added until one team wins. </li>

                <li> Substitutions: Coaches are allowed to substitute players in and out of the game during timeouts,
                    free
                    throws, and dead ball situations.<br> However, the same player cannot re-enter the game after being
                    substituted out.</li>

        <h2>Ping-Pong</h2>
        <div id="pmean">
            <h3>meaning</h3>
            <p>Ping Pong is a term commonly used to refer to the sport of table tennis.
                It is a game played with small paddles and a lightweight ball on a table divided <br> by a
                net. The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth over the net, with the
                goal of making the ball land on the opponent's side of the table, <br> and thus score a point.
                The name "ping pong" was derived from the sound made by the ball when it is hit back and
                forth across the table. Ping pong is a popular <br> sport played both recreationally and
                competitively all over the world, and is even an Olympic sport.</p>
            <h3>rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Service: A player must hit the ball from behind the end of the table, with the ball resting on an
                    open
                    palm, and the ball must be tossed upwards at least 6 inches before being hit.</li>

                <li>Return: The ball must be returned over the net and hit the opponent's side of the table. The ball
                    cannot touch the net or edges of the table during the rally.</li>

                <li>Scoring: Points are awarded to the player who wins a rally. A game is typically played to 11 points,
                    and the winner must be ahead by at least two points.</li>

                <li>Change of Service: After every two points, the player who served last must give the ball to the
                    opponent to serve.</li>

                <li>Let: A let is called if the ball hits the net on a serve, and the ball is re-served without
                    penalty.</li>

                <li>Doubles: In doubles play, teammates take turns serving the ball and players must alternate hitting
                    the
                    ball. <br>The ball must also bounce on each side of the table at least once during a rally.</li>
